# Hybrid Approach For Securing Data
During data transmission over the internet, it is important to transfer data in high security and high
confidentiality, information security is the most important issue of data communication in networks and internet.
To secure transferred information from intruders, it is important to convert information into the cryptic format.
Different methods are used to ensure data security and confidentiality during transmissions like Steganography
and cryptography. Proposed work improves information security through developing efficient compression of
texts and encryption of texts by cryptography with steganography. The Proposed algorithm ensures the encryption
and decryption using AES, compression and decompression by using LZW and RGB pixel shuffling with
steganography. LSB method is used to insert data bits in LSB of RGB pixels of the cover image. In this Multi-
threading use to retrieve information from image rapidly. Hence proposed system can reduce the data
transmission time and cost. These algorithms are performed by using JAVA program.
